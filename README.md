## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a former cross-platform development student at [IESCampanilas](https://github.com/IESCampanillas) and a current student in Universidad de MÃ¡laga (UMA) as an undergraduate in Software Engineering. I am a self-motivated, hard-working, consistent junior developer and person willing to bring out the best of myself; and most importantly, I am a competent professional always willing to learn more and go above and beyond.

I like to explore and work with multiple technologies, and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in technology and more niche areas; my strong areas are web development and cross-platform software development.

You can check out more about me in the profiles in my sidebar and in my projects!
